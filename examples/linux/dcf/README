examples/linux/dcf

A DCF example for Linux
------------------------
This project is quite different from other examples.
It is a much more recent one, and the way CanFestival is initialized is a bit different.
Besides DCF, it shows how to write canopen master and slave with CanFestival under Linux OS, how to attach callbacks
to objdict entries and more.

The master use a txt file (dcfdata.txt) in order to fill index 0x1f22 with concise DCF data.
Also hearbeat is used and it shows how the master can keep an image of the slave nodes status.
In slaves, hearbeat producer time is set by the master with concise dcf.

The master binary is launched with the socketcan interface as first argument:
./master can0

The slave also has socketcan interface as first argument, but the is a second argument for the node id.
It allows to launch several instance of slave with different node ids.
./slave can0 1
./slave can0 2
./slave can0 3

The objdict of the master is designed to interact with 3 slaves.
When a slave is started or stopped (with ctrl-c) the masters displays the new slave state.

Also Master and Slaves are exchanging datas using PDOs
