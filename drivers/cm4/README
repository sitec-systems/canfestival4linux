This is a short how to for ARM Cortex-M4 MCU support in Canfestival
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Only the STM32F373 is supported but code should be easily ported to other CM4
MCUs. 
The code use the ST periph lib so you need access to the headers.
This is done thrue the LIB_ROOT var in the Makefiles or with a symlink.
See below how to set this up.

First put the toolchain binaries in your PATH :
#export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/my/toolchain/bin

run the canfestival configure script :
#./configure ./configure --target=cm4

If your toolchain prefix is not arm-none-eabi- you can use --cc=my-prefix-gcc
but you will have to add your CFLAGS in the Makefiles.

There are two Makefiles involved : src/Makefile and drivers/cm4/Makefile 
Edit those two and adapt the LIB_ROOT path to your need, or better make in
include/cm4 a symlink called stlib to the periph driver lib :
#cd include/cm4
#ln -s ~/STM32F37x_DSP_StdPeriph_Lib_V1.0.0/Libraries/ stdlib

Finaly go to canfestival root directory and type:
#make

For simplification the driver/cm4 code is put in src/libcanfestival.a with all
the stack code. So you only have to link with one library.
